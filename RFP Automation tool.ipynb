However the SI-S would also procure, install, maintain and operate (including movement of schedules between storage and scanning) the necessary scanners for all the 18 locations for scanning purpose.\n",
      "Pre Scanning Operations: The pre scanning activities (Document preparation for scanning) would involve activities like removing extraneous objects like pins, staples, clips, tags, blades etc from the bundles of forms; decreasing any crumpled forms; dehumidification; preparing batches of forms for scanning etc. The SI-S would be required to engage sufficient manpower for all these activities.\n",
      "Movement of batches to and from Scanning Centre: Scanning will have to be conducted in a batch mode. The SI-S has to ensure the movement of the batches of forms for scanning and back to storage after the scanning is completed in a systematic manner. The required appliances for moving the prepared batches will have to be arranged by the SI-S. The SI-S will have to ensure that inventory is maintained at every stage of the operation. Movement of Forms from Receipt to placing it back after scanning would be the responsibility of SI.\n",

      "Fortnightly preventive maintenance\n",
      "The Final scanning output Per day, per scanner excluding the rescanning should not be less than 1,25,000 Census Schedules. For the calculation purpose, it will be done on weekly or as decided by the ORGI/DCOs.\n",

      "Rate of penalty for scanner down time will be 0.5 percent of total cost of each scanner on weekly basis.\n",
      "In case the output falls short of the desired number of forms, the penalty will be imposed on the number of forms by which productivity is short as per the Cost per form mentioned in RFP Clause No 27.
